#Encrypting and Decrypting using XOR and Inverter
 There are  reasons for using encryption:
• Helps you to protect your confidential data such as passwords and login id.
• Provides confidentiality of private information.
• Helps you to ensure that that the document or file has not been altered.
• Encryption process also prevents plagiarism.
• Helpful for network communication and where a hacker can easily access unencrypted data.
• It is an essential method as it helps you to securely protect data that you don’t want anyone else to have access.
 
Future Improvements: 
-Adding GUI [ graphical user interface ] because that allows users to interact with programs in different ways than typing, thus being more user-friendly.
- Avoiding using functions that return pointers and implementing more robust means that perform the required tasks.
- Adding the option to encrypt using a keyword as the key instead of a number, hence adding an extra layer of security to the encrypted data.
- File handling so that the user would be able to save the the output to an external file to be used somewhere else.
- Encrypting full files not just strings.
